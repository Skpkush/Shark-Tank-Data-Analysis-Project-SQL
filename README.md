# Shark-Tank-Data-Analysis-Project-SQL

### Shark Tank SQL Project Description

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from *Shark Tank India* to extract valuable insights about investments, entrepreneurs, industries, and pitches. By leveraging SQL, I performed advanced data analysis to uncover trends and patterns in the startup ecosystem showcased on the show. The aim of the project was to understand the preferences of investors (Sharks), evaluate the success of pitches, and analyze the distribution of funding across industries and entrepreneurs.
